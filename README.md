# ML23/24-08 Implement Anomaly Detection Sample

# Introduction:

HTM (Hierarchical Temporal Memory) is a machine learning algorithm, which uses a hierarchical network of nodes to process time-series data in a distributed way. Each nodes, or columns, can be trained to learn, and recognize patterns in input data. This can be used in identifying anomalies/deviations from normal patterns. It is a promising approach for anomaly detection and prediction in a variety of applications. In our project, we are going to use multisequencelearning class in NeoCortex API to implement an anomaly detection system, such that numerical sequences are read from multiple csv files inside a folder, train our HTM Engine, and use the trained engine for learning patterns and detect anomalies.  

# Requirements

To run this project, we need.
* [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
* Nuget package: [NeoCortexApi Version= 1.1.4](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NeoCortexApi/)

For code debugging, we recommend using visual studio IDE/visual studio code. This project can be run on [github codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) as well.

# Usage

To run this project, 

* Install .NET SDK. Then using code editor/IDE of your choice, create a new console project and place all the C# codes inside your project folder. 
* Add/reference nuget package NeoCortexApi v1.1.4 to this project.
* Place numerical sequence CSV Files (datasets) under relevant folders respectively. All the folders should be inside the project folder. More details given below.

Our project is based on NeoCortex API. More details [here](https://github.com/ddobric/neocortexapi/blob/master/source/Documentation/gettingStarted.md).

# Working Process

Here is the working priciple in a single graph to understand the steps to follow to execute and develop this project.

# Details

We have used [MultiSequenceLearning](https://github.com/ddobric/neocortexapi/blob/master/source/Samples/NeoCortexApiSample/MultisequenceLearning.cs) class in NeoCortex API for training our HTM Engine. We are going to start by reading and using data from both our training (learning) folder (present as numerical sequences in CSV Files in 'training' folder inside project directory) and predicting folder (present as numerical sequences in CSV Files in 'predicting' folder inside project directory) to train HTM Engine. For testing purposes, we are going to read numerical sequence data from predicting folder and remove the first few elements (essentially, making it subsequence of the original sequence; we already added anomalies in this data at random indexes), and then use it to detect anomalies.

Please note that all files are read with .csv extension inside the folders, and exception handlers are in place if the format of the files are not in proper order.

For this project, we are using artificial integer sequence data of network load (rounded off to nearest integer, in precentage), which are stored inside the csv files. Example of a csv file within training folder.

```
49,52,55,48,52,47,46,50,52,47
49,52,55,48,52,47,46,50,49,47
.............................
.............................
48,54,55,48,52,47,46,50,49,45
51,54,55,48,52,47,46,50,49,45
```
Normally, the values stay within the range of 45 to 55. For testing, we consider anything outside this range to be an anomaly. We have uploaded the graphs of our data in this repository for reference. 

1. Graph for numerical sequence data from training folder (without anomalies) can be found [here](need to add jpg of the graph URL).
2. Graph of combined numerical sequence data from training folder (without anomalies) and predicting folder (with anomalies) can be found [here](need to add jpg of the graph URL).
   
### Encoding:

Encoding of our input data is very important, such that it can be processed by our HTM Engine. More on [this](https://github.com/ddobric/neocortexapi/blob/master/source/Documentation/Encoders.md). 

As we are going to train and test data between the range of integer values between 0-100 with no periodicity, we are using the following settings. Minimum and maximum values are set to 0 and 100 respectively, as we are expecting all the values to be in this range only. In other used cases, these values need to be changed.

```csharp

int inputBits = 121;
int numColumns = 1210;
.......................
.......................
double max = 100;

Dictionary<string, object> settings = new Dictionary<string, object>()
            {
                { "W", 21},
                ...........
                { "MinVal", 0.0},
                ...........
                { "MaxVal", max}
            };
 ```
 
 Complete settings:
 
 ```csharp

Dictionary<string, object> settings = new Dictionary<string, object>()
            {
                { "W", 21},
                { "N", inputBits},
                { "Radius", -1.0},
                { "MinVal", 0.0},
                { "Periodic", false},
                { "Name", "integer"},
                { "ClipInput", false},
                { "MaxVal", max}
            };
```

### HTM Configuration:

We have used the following configuration. More on [this](https://github.com/ddobric/neocortexapi/blob/master/source/Documentation/SpatialPooler.md#parameter-desription)

```csharp
{
                Random = new ThreadSafeRandom(42),

                CellsPerColumn = 25,
                GlobalInhibition = true,
                LocalAreaDensity = -1,
                NumActiveColumnsPerInhArea = 0.02 * numColumns,
                PotentialRadius = (int)(0.15 * inputBits),
                //InhibitionRadius = 15,

                MaxBoost = 10.0,
                DutyCyclePeriod = 25,
                MinPctOverlapDutyCycles = 0.75,
                MaxSynapsesPerSegment = (int)(0.02 * numColumns),

                ActivationThreshold = 15,
                ConnectedPermanence = 0.5,

                // Learning is slower than forgetting in this case.
                PermanenceDecrement = 0.25,
                PermanenceIncrement = 0.15,

                // Used by punishing of segments.
                PredictedSegmentDecrement = 0.1
};
```

### Multisequence learning

The [RunExperiment](https://github.com/SouravPaulSumit/Team_anomaly/blob/be27813af65f611df7cbd33009d72a3ee72e3756/mySEProject/AnomalyDetectionSample/multisequencelearning.cs#L75) method inside the [multisequencelearning](https://github.com/SouravPaulSumit/Team_anomaly/blob/master/mySEProject/AnomalyDetectionSample/multisequencelearning.cs) class file demonstrates how multisequence learning works. To summarize, 

* HTM Configuration is taken and memory of connections are initialized. After that, HTM Classifier, Cortex layer and HomeostaticPlasticityController are initialized.
```csharp
.......
var mem = new Connections(cfg);
.......
HtmClassifier<string, ComputeCycle> cls = new HtmClassifier<string, ComputeCycle>();
CortexLayer<object, object> layer1 = new CortexLayer<object, object>("L1");
HomeostaticPlasticityController hpc = new HomeostaticPlasticityController(mem, numUniqueInputs * 150, (isStable, numPatterns, actColAvg, seenInputs) => ..
.......
.......
```

* After that, Spatial Pooler and Temporal Memory is initialized.
```csharp
.....
TemporalMemory tm = new TemporalMemory();
SpatialPoolerMT sp = new SpatialPoolerMT(hpc);
.....
```
* After that, spatial pooler memory is added to cortex layer and trained for maximum number of cycles.
```csharp
.....
layer1.HtmModules.Add("sp", sp);
int maxCycles = 3500;
for (int i = 0; i < maxCycles && isInStableState == false; i++)
.....
`````
* After that, temporal memory is added to cortex layer to learn all the input sequences.
```csharp
.....
layer1.HtmModules.Add("tm", tm);
foreach (var sequenceKeyPair in sequences){
.....
}
.....
```
* Finally, the trained cortex layer and HTM classifier is returned.
```csharp
.....
return new Predictor(layer1, mem, cls)
.....
`````
We will use this for prediction in later parts of our project.

## Execution of the project

Our project is executed in the following way. 

**Under construction**
 
# Results

After running this project, we got the following [Output](https://github.com/HasibuzzamanFUAS/neocortexapi_Simply-Coders/tree/master/MYSEProject/AnomalyDetectionSample/output)

We can observe that the false negative rate is high in our output (0.65). It is desired that false negative rate should be as lower as possible in an anomaly detection program. Lower false positive rate is also desirable, but not absolutely essential.

Although, it depends on a number of factors, like quantity (the more, the better) and quality of data, and hyperparameters used to tune and train model; more data should be used for training, and hyperparameters should be further tuned to find the most optimal setting for training to get the best results. We were using less amount of numerical sequences as data to demonstrate our sample project due to time and computational constraints, but that can be improved if we use better resources, like cloud.
